> Analysis Page Updates

Brand new look and feel. We added four cards to the page: BigMacPPP, Portfolio Diversification, Home Price Index and Rule of 72. 

The Big Mac index, also known as Big Mac PPP, is a survey done by The Economist magazine that is used to measure the purchasing power parity (PPP) between nations, using the price of a Big Mac as the benchmark.

We use IPC (Intra-Portfolio Correlation) to quantify portfolio diversification. The IPC can be from -1 to +1. The closer it is to -1 the more diversified your portfolio is. The closer IPC is to +1 the less diversified your portfolio is. We use the adjusted value as the score of a portfolio. 

We use S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price Index. It seeks to measures the value of residential real estate in 20 major U.S. metropolitan areas, e.g. Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa and Washington, D.C.

The Rule of 72 is the simplest way to calculate how long you can double your portfolio, given an annualized return rate. For example, given a 36% return rate, you can expect your portfolio to double in 2 years.
