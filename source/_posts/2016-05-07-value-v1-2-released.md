# Value v1.2 Released

***

We are happy to announce that [**Value v1.2**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/value-turn-investors-idea/id1020357535?ls=1&mt=8 "Value v1.2 - App Store") has been released today! This release is a feature release.

> New Analysis Page

Brand new look and feel. We added two cards to the page: VIX(CBOE Volatility Index) and BDI(Baltic Dry Index). The VIX is a measure of the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options. It shows the market's expectation of 30-day volatility. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a measure of the price of shipping major raw materials such as metals, grains, and fossil fuels by sea.

> Market Pulse Updates: Canada Market

Since Value v1.1, we renamed the Clustering page to Pulse, which gives our users a more comprehensive view of a realistic financial market. The goal of the new Pulse page was to help us to understand different market conditions. And in v1.2, we added Canada Market to the list.

> Leaner Page

Curated list of books, podcasts, moocs, and more. We're learning to learn, learn to become a better investor. Find helpful informations to grow your investment knowledge, and most importantly: transfer knowledge to wisdom.

From the Learner, you can find the best investment and trading books. Keep up with latest trading ideas with collections of podcasts. If you fancy an online course, we also have some recommendations for you.
