# Bear market times
> Bear Market Series - 1

***

Do you know how many times the stock market disintegrated into a [**bear market**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp "Investopedia: Bear market")? Not surprisingly, many times!

To help investors to understand the bear markets, here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about this significant market condition:

**1. What is a bear market**?
> _keywords_: **20%** and **2 months**
 
The usual definition of a bear market is that when stocks in multiple broad market indexes, such as the [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=983582 "DJIA") or [Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500)](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=626307 "S&P 500") decline more than (at least) **20%** from their peaks, and last more than (at least) **2 months**.

***

**2. How long do bear markets typically last?**
> _keywords_: **2 versions**, average **15 months** or **25 months**, comparing to a **1/2** of the average [**Bull markets**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp "Investopedia: Bull market") periods.

Due to the different definition of a bear market, and the index ([DJIA](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=983582 "DJIA"), [S&P 500](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=626307 "S&P 500") or [WSCI World](https://www.msci.com/world "WSCI World")) that used to conduct the research, there are at least 2 versions about the average bear markets length.

**First version:** According to [Ned Davis Research (1998)](https://books.google.com/books?id=xXyx5k-EwM8C&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=bear+market+times+since+1900&source=bl&ots=KkX6B0yBP8&sig=vRPqQ3UhjafHx-MChrpZcLvDB2s&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=bear%20market%20times%20since%201900&f=false) and the ones happened in 1990-2015, there were 33 bear markets, with an average length of **15 months**.


**Second version:** A recent research [paper](http://www.businessinsider.com/last-10-us-bear-markets-2016-1 "Last 10 Bear markets") of [J.P. Morgan Asset Management](https://am.jpmorgan.com/) suggests that, the last 10 bear markets (which including the 1929 Wall Street Crash, 1937 Fed Tightening/Recession, 2000 Dot-com bubble and 2007 Global financial crisis) usually last **25 months**.

And for the subsequent bull runs, no matter which version you used, the average length of a bull market is about **2 times** of a bear market.

***

**3. How often do bear markets happen?**
> _keywords_: every **3.5 years**, or the average length of bear markets + bull markets

If we use the first version of the bear market length (15 months), the answer is **45 months** (15 months multiply 3). However, since there are a lot of uncertainties that affect the market over the years, we can't simply use these average lengths to predict the start/end of a bear market.

For example, during the Wall Street Crash of 1929-34, actually 9 bear markets were happened according to an [article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/99902-historical-bull-and-bear-markets-for-the-dow-1900-present) on seekingalpha.com

**4. How to gauge the bear market?**
> _keywords_: **Citi's bear market checklist**, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management Research (**Recession, Commodity Spike, Aggressive Fed, Extreme Valuations**)

Do you believe someone can really predict the bear market? Yes and No! It is a well known fact that, for many years, the prediction accuracy were no better than tossing a coin. Nevertheless, it does not mean [analysis](http://www.gimletech.com "Value app") is not necessary.

If you more cared about the **global** economy and have assets in [**emerging markets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets "Wikipedia: Emerging markets") (particularly China), check out this two articles about the Citi's bear market checklist:

- [What Does Citi's "Bear Market Checklist" Predict About The Future](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-05/where-does-world-currently-stand-citis-bear-market-checklist "Zero hedge")

- [Citi's bear market checklist](http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/15/08/5789592/citis-bear-market-checklist "Benzinga")

> _Download our [Value app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/value-turn-investors-idea/id1020357535?ls=1&mt=8 "Value - Turn investors' idea into innovation") and have a more intuitive look about this market gauge_

<img src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlt1/v/t1.0-9/12729164_921536767964708_2037300212668579461_n.png?oh=a80715631e53a474e9d4d27242931b59&oe=57279256" alt="Value - Turn investors' idea into innovation" style="width: 320px;"/>

The checklist uses **16** different indicators to determine the likelihood of a bear market, but have to say, some of them are not very useful if you require a time-sensitive (if you know there have a regular updates of any of the indicator, draw us a line. We listed some of them here at the **end of this article**) judgement to the market condition.

[The J.P. Morgan's research](http://www.businessinsider.com/last-10-us-bear-markets-2016-1 "Last 10 Bear markets"), on the other hand, is more like a high level view of bear markets to put it down to **4 categories:**

- Recession: The most common factor which has coincided with a bear market **8 times**. 
- Extreme valuations: **5 times**
- Commodity spikes: **4 times**
- Aggressive Fed tightening: **4 times**

***

**5. What to expect from a bear market?**
> _keywords_: International **asset allocations** and [**capital flows**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-flows.asp "Investpedia: Capital flows")

No doubt that, every time when the market headed into bearish, besides fear and sell, we should expect something different, i.e., **opportunities**.

So, where is the opportunity?

We believe that opportunities are lies in changes. And put it in investment context, we mean capital flows. Asset-class movements, Mutual fund flows, Capital-spending budgets and Federal budget, there are too many things need to know. But make it simply, we have a sustained interest in the Venture capital (investments in startup businesses). Any trends in VCs (the most sensitive companies) might indicate future investment opportunities (Market - Sector - Companies).

Finally, our view towards the bear markets:
>_It was the worst of times, it is the best times_
