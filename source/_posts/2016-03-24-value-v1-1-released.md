# Value v1.1 Released

***

We are happy to announce that [**Value v1.1**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/value-turn-investors-idea/id1020357535?ls=1&mt=8 "Value v1.1 - App Store") has been released today! This release has taken a bit longer to finish than we originally expected, mostly because we put a new feature in place, allowing us to make Value v1.1 a feature (but not a bug fixing) release.

> New Feature: Market Pulse

From Value v1.1, we will rename the Clustering page to Pulse, which gives our users a more comprehensive view of a realistic financial market. The goal of the new Pulse page is to help us to understand different market conditions (and our ultimate goal: Regime Switching):

> General improvements

It has been a month since we released Value v1.0 and thanks for our our users who sent us feedback. Here is the improvements we made in v1.1:
