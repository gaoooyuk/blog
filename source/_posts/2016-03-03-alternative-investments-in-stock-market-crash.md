# Alternative investments in stock market crash
> Bear Market Series - 2

***

Alternative investments were once an option for only institutions, endowments and [HNWIs](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hnwi.asp "Investopedia: High Net Worth Individual") (High Net Worth Individuals). But after experienced in 2008 [financial crisis](http://gimletech.com/blog/2016/02/23/2016-02-23-Bear-market-times/ "Bear market times"), with the gradual opening of the alternative investments market and the investment philosophy changing of the globe, investors have become more concerned about finding safe-haven assets in bear markets. Of course, hedging is the key, but if these investments can also generate a decent income, why not try?

To help investors to understand the alternative investments, here are answers to the most frequently asked questions. 

**1. Common Alternative Investments Categories**
> _keywords_: **6** categories: **PE**, **VC**, **REITs**, **Leveraged buyout**, **FOF**, and **Real assets**

PE (Private Equity), VC (Venture Capital) and VL (Venture Lending) are concepts in the field of Private Capital Investment. Comparison across the globe, the number of [private companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company "Wikipedia: Privately held company") is far greater than the number of companies listed on the stock exchanges. Unlike VC firms geared to business incubation stage investment, PE investments are more focused on companies that have succeed in their startup stage. Of course, due to the different stages this two investments involved in, they are different in both risk-reward, valuation, [investment Horizon](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment_horizon.asp "Investopedia: Investment horizon") and exits ways.

![alt VC/PE](https://scontent-nrt1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12803033_926535210798197_5683895615017232212_n.png?oh=0ee98229367d56f0316a6c14dc09c998&oe=5796B7EF "Difference: VC & PE")

The emergence of Real Estate Investment Trusts (or REITs), on the one hand enhanced the efficiency of capital returns of large commercial real estate. On another hand also gave individual investors the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate, and to benefit from the dividend income(**REITs are required to payout at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends**). Investors can invest in different countries, different types of high-quality real estate, and by the allocation of resources to reduce the correlation of the overall investment in real estate projects, thereby reducing the risk. There are **5** common types of REITs.

Real assets are those things that can be proven to be long-term preservation and valuable. The history of real assets investment is much earlier than the emergence of stock market. These real assets have capital elements, but beyond the control of capitals. For example: artwork, luxury goods (jewelry, watches), wine, as well as a variety of rare things. Real assets are usually tangible assets, excluding intangible assets category which boomed over the past ten years (e.g. domain name, bitcoin, litecoin)

**2. Why Alternative Investments?**
> _keywords_: more **diversified** portfolio and **low correlation** with stock markets, and **valuation uncertainty**

Why should we in a bear or even bull market, choose to allocate our assets to alternative investments. The answer is: **Risk-Reward Tradeoff**.

**3. Alternative Investments Disadvantages?**
> _keywords_: **transparency**, **liquidity** and **valuation** concerns

When we talk about alternative investments are becoming mainstream in investment markets during the depression, we also talk about their shortcomings.

The first disadvantage is the **market supervision** and its strength. Comparing to the stock market, there is still room for improvements. The stock market has transparency requirements for the listed companies. Companies must disclose their information in a timely manner. In most of times, the **quotes** reflect those information (Although this kind of feedback can not really reflect the [**intrinsic value**](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp "Investopedia: Intrinsic Value") of the company). But for alternative investments, we can hardly ask PE, VC or Real assets (managers) to give us the latest feedback of the investments. Of course, we might be able to put it down to the investments themselves. That is, before we enter the market, we may already know the rent will be charged monthly but not daily, and the liquidity of artworks or luxury goods is less than other assets. That's the risk we should aware of.

Which followed by is the liquidity problems. The problem of liquidity will make **withdrawal** extremely difficult for retail investors.

And the last one is the alternative Investments valuation concerns.

**4. Firms that specialised in alternative investments solutions and services**
> _keywords_: big name companies like: **Blackstone**, **The Yale Endowment**, **Vanguard**

The alternative investments that belongs only to institutions, endowments and [HNWIs](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hnwi.asp "Investopedia: High Net Worth Individual") in the past are no longer the blue sea for investors. In order to earn huge profits, companies no matter large or small, are facing more competitions in this red sea. However, because of the more opened market and increased market competition, the companies that have the absolute capital advantages and strategic visions can still grab a lot of benefits from the winds and waves.

Blackstone is one of them. In [King of Capital](http://amzn.to/1L54Neu "The Remarkable Rise, Fall, and Rise Again of Steve Schwarzman and Blackstone"), this 1985 founded company has been very low key before its IPO(Except the $3M Birthday Party of its Founder and CEO [Steve Schwarzman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman "Wikipedia: Stephen A. Schwarzman")). And in its global business, the most talked about is the LBOs, namely Leveraged buyouts. [Blackstone](http://www.blackstone.com/ "Blackstone Group") buys a company and finances it using a combination of debt and equity, with the debt sitting on the balance sheet of the acquired company. After the deal, Blackstone obtains the control of the acquired company, and helps the company to generate enough free cash flow (to pay down the debt over time) before selling the company. The average **Debt/EBITDA ratio** used in these deals were around **6.0-6.5x** trailing, and how much the PE firms want to buy with their own cash is case by case. Besides Blackstone, you may also be interested in [KKR](www.kkr.com/ "KKR & Co. L.P.").

And in the field of [endowment fund](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-fund.asp "Investopedia: Endowment Fund"), [The Yale Endowment](http://investments.yale.edu/ "The Yale Endowment") is unique. In a recent (Year 2015) investment return report, The Yale Endowment gains a revenue of **11.5%** in the most turbulent year, after the Financial Crisis 2008. Once again proved its investment philosophy with the impressive performance (average yield of **13.7%**) in the past 20 years. The fund currently has **$25.6** billion in total assets. And in its latest (Year 2016) investment plan, a total of **32.5%** will continue to be used for PE and VC investment, and **16.0%** will be used for LBOs.

![alt Yale Plan](https://scontent-nrt1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpl1/v/t1.0-9/12043055_926535190798199_6000797158935049423_n.png?oh=95d613c8fec02f5b080fc2934327fb65&oe=576695DE "The Yale Endowment Plan 2016")

The [Vanguard Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group "Wikipedia: The Vanguard Group") is an American investment management company based in Pennsylvania, that manages approximately **$3.0** trillion (Year 2014) in assets. Founded by [John C. Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle "Wikipedia: John C. Bogle") in 1975, Vanguard now manages about **160** U.S. funds and about **120** additional funds in markets outside the United States, as of December 31, 2014. In alternative investments, Vanguard has, for example, Vanguard REIT ETF ([VNQ](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=704702 "Vanguard REIT Index Fund")) and Vanguard Precious Metals and Mining Fund ([VGPMX](https://www.google.com/finance?q=VGPMX "Vanguard Precious Metals And Mining Fund Investor Shares"), which owns a mix of gold and commodity producers) for investors.

Besides aforementioned big name companies, we have more choices than ever. With the growth of [FinTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology "Wikipedia: Financial Technology") companies in 2014 and 2015, the alternative investments market becomes much more easier for investors to invest aforementioned categories. Here is the short list:

Company Name | Specialisation | Website
--- | --- | ---
OurCrowd | Startups | http://ourcrowd.com
CircleUp | Connecting Investors with Consumer Brands | https://circleup.com/
AngelList | Startups | http://angel.co
Equitise | Crowd funding | http://equitise.co.nz/
MyMicroInvest | European startups and [SME’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises "Wikipedia: Small and medium-sized enterprises") | https://www.mymicroinvest.com/en
Property Partner | Property Crowdfunding | https://propertypartner.co/
Syndicate Room | Intelligent Equity Crowdfunding | https://www.syndicateroom.com/

Global economies are more connected than ever, making it difficult to rely solely on one market to build a diversified and profitable portfolio. Therefore, we should pay more attention to alternative investments.
